# Class-Operator-Demonstration
A class project from my sophomore year of college that demonstrates being able to use mathematical and conditional operators with occurrence of a class. In the main program, you can add/subteact/etc trees, but because the abount of leaves is the only operator, that only changes the number of leaves. The comparitive oporators like less than, greater than, etc are all used to compare all three attributes.<br/>
Language: C++<br/>

## Instructions
Follow the promts and enter a tree's number of leafs, leaf color and bark color as the program asks. The program will print your tree to  the console, print the pre-configured tree3 to the console, then print it again after it is assigned to be equal to your tree.
